# From Python to C - The Rosetta Stone Lecture

This repository is a collection of practical examples presented by Dr. Chuck Severance, illustrating the fundamental concepts and syntax equivalencies between Python and C. The examples provide a comprehensive introduction to the world of C programming while leveraging Python as a bridge for understanding.

Whether you're a newcomer to C programming or looking to solidify your Python skills, this repository offers a hands-on approach to comparing the two languages. Explore the code, experiment, and enhance your proficiency in both Python and C.

## Dr. Chuck's Python to C Lecture Notes 

- C is the mother tongue of advanced programming languages
- Python is written in C and deeply influenced by C
  
|      Python                                   |        C                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------| ----------------------------------------------------|
|             White space is essential          |                 Whitespace ignored                  |
|               Very object-oriented            |              Not object-oriented at all             |
| Convenient data structures (list, dict, etc.) | Fast, efficient, powerful (struct, pointers, etc.)  |
|             Auto memory management            |               Manual memory management              |
|                      1980s                    |                         1970s                       |

## Similarities​ : 
- Arithmetic Operators: + - * / % ​

- Comparison Operators: == != < > <= the same​

- Variable naming rules – letter/underscore + numbers/letters/underscores – also case matters​

- While loops – also break and continue in loops​

- Constants similar except for strings and characters and booleans​

- Both have int / float, and char / byte​

  - C has no str, list, or dict​

  - Python has no struct or double
